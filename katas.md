## Katas TDD/Clean Code/Refactoring

### Mob programming
In a first step for those topics, I mainly do coding kata with team using mob programing. I use the randori technic to be sure that every team member will have a chance to code.
First write a failing test, second make the test pass and write another failing test, etc

If done physically I use wireless keyboard and mouse on my own laptop so that developer don't lose time to setup a working new project on their own.
I don't know why, but it seems that creating a new Project is very often an issue for most of the dev I have seen in SG ;-(

Remotely I use the same Randori pace with a sync mechanism with a small shell script that push or pull automatically the code to/from github. Each developer have to launch this script so that they are always in sync. The one that have the keyboard share his screen

In a second step, I am triing to make the team do a refactoring in their own code base. I ask them to choose even part of a enhancement they have in their backlog, or a bugfix.

### FizzBuzz
It is often the first Kata I do with a team that wants to improve on code quality
I use FizzBuzz kata to introduce TDD to teams. 
It is very simple so it helps to really explain the principles of the RGR loop.
I use it also to introduce Arrange Act Assert structure of a test method and what's behind the F.I.R.S.T. acronyme.

Sometimes if the team is still receptive after it, I introduce quickly the SOLID principles and ask the team to challenge
the produced code regarding those principles. I try to make them see that at least the O/C principle was violated during the coding session


### Roman To Arabic numerals Kata
This kata is very useful to feel the need of baby stepping. I am not using it very often, only if I have long time to coach the team
